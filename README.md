> The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the likeness
of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN, consisting
of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child images. The experiments
demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an average of 13.14%
across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by 9.1% in terms of
racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjectsâ€™ identities better than
SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.Our method conduct a fine grained module called race mixer in-order to
Generalize the models capability on Generating desirable image with preserved ethnicity and with few amount of data.
